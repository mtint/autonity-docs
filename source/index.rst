Autonity
====================================

Autonity is a generalisation of the `Ethereum Protocol`_ adding several features that make it applicable for permissioned networks. 

Autonity supports deterministic finality, and the ability to permission validators and network access. 
Autonity works in harmony with Ion_, a general interoperabillity framework, to support interoperability between Ethereum chains, and even Ethereum and non-Ethereum platforms.

Get started by running the Autonity Hello World that will allow you to run a local Autonity network in about two minutes.
