Autonity
====================================

Autonity is a generalisation of the `Ethereum Protocol`_ adding several features that make it applicable for permissioned networks. 

Autonity supports deterministic finality, and the ability to permission validators and network access. 

Autonity also forms part of a protocol suite with Ion_, an interoperabillity protocol, to support interoperability between Ethereum and non-Ethereum chains. 

Get started by running the Autonity Hello World that will allow you to run a local Autonity network in about two minutes.
