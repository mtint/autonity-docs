Observer DApp
====================================

Autonity supports network permissioning in private blockchains by leveraging a smart contract which manages which nodes can access the network.
Keeping a consistent state of the list of members of nodes is technically feasible due to the finality property (i.e. no forks) of BFT-like consensus protocols
used by the Autonity client.

The restriction of access to the ledger can be tackled at different layers of the network stack and providing various levels of access to the nodes in the network.
The main network and protocol layers at which the permissioning can be implemented are TCP/IP level and below (e.g. physical level), DevP2P, Ethereum Service protocol level or at the sub-protocol
level (e.g. Ethereum v.63). In terms of the level of access granted, the members of the network may be able to read the contents of the ledger (i.e. blockchain observers), append blocks into
the chain (i.e. miners or validators) and send transactions to be inserted in blocks by the validators.

In our first release, our solution targets the restriction of read-access to the blockchain implementing minimal

In our first release, our solution targets the restriction of read-access to the blockchain implementing minimal light modifications at the Ethereum protocol level.


.. note:: More fine-grained permissioning solutions at different layers of the stack are present in the Autonity roadmap.
