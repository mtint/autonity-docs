Validator DApp
====================================

Autonity supports network permissioning in private blockchains by leveraging a smart contract which manages which nodes can access the network.
Keeping a consistent state of the list of members of nodes is technically feasible due to the finality property (i.e. no forks) of BFT-like consensus protocols
used by the Autonity client.

.. note:: Metamask is having issues running on Firefox. This bug was reported back in August 2018 and we're awaiting a fix. Until then please use Chrome.
