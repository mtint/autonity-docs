Ion
====================================

Ion_ is a platform agnostic interoperability framework. It allows state and value to be transferred between disparate blockchains without the need for an intermediary token or a trusted intermediary.

The Ion project currently has validation contracts for 

- Clique (Ethereum)
- IPBFT (Ethereum)
- Hyperledger

The Ion_ Github repository has a full example of transfering value between a local test chain and Rinkeby. The `Simple Shares`_ example shows a full DvP flow, modelling the issuance of a security on Hyperledger and the settlement of a trade on an Ethereum chain.
