Network Permissioning
==========================

The Autonity client approach to network permissioning leverages the use of smart contracts to manage the validator set and the nodes which have access to the network.
This form of on-chain governance enables the deployer of a private blockchain to fully customize the governance mechanism of the network.

Autonity network permissioning features follow a modular architecture, composed by two main components: **Soma**, which manages the validator set governance and **Glienicke**,
that controls the node permissioning at the P2P network level.
