Minikube
==========================================

Minikube enables you to run a Kubernetes cluster locally on MacOS, Windows and Linux. Using Minikube, you can run an Autonity network on your local machine.

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need a basic understanding of using a terminal. Install the following software:

- `Installation git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_
- `Installation minikube  <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/>`_
- `Installation helm <https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm>`_

From the terminal ensure that everything was correctly installed.

.. code:: bash

    git --version
    minikube version
    helm version

You should see the version numbers for the installs printed back to the terminal.

Install Minikube
----------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   install_minikube.rst


Starting Minikube
-----------------

Minikube starts a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine that you can deploy services into. You will be starting Minikube so that you can use the helm charts to start an Autonity network.

Open a new terminal and run

.. code:: bash

    minikube start

Depending on your local environment this may start some downloads to complete the minikube installation. It may take a few moments. Once minikube has finished booting it will print a line stating the local IP address of the cluster.

If you see the following, the cluster has started and is ready to go.

.. code:: bash

    üèÑ  Done! Thank you for using minikube!


Deploy Tiller to the cluster and configure helm
-----------------------------------------------

The following command deploys tiller into the cluster and gives you possibilities to deploy packages using helm

.. code:: bash

    helm init
