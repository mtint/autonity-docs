**What it is new heading**

Autonity is a generalisation of the `Ethereum Protocol`_ and has features that make it applicable for permissioned networks: 

- Autonity supports deterministic finality, and has the ability to permission validators and network access 
- Autonity works in harmony with Ion_, a general interoperabillity framework, to support interoperability between Ethereum chains, and even Ethereum and non-Ethereum platforms
